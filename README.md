# BGP SPARQL Implementation Project

This repository contains a project for implementing the Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) SPARQL query execution method based on the research paper studied during the Database Implementation course at the University of Oxford. The project is developed using C++17.

## Overview

This project aims to implement the BGP SPARQL query execution method, which is an essential component of SPARQL query processing engines. The implementation is based on the research paper provided during the Database Implementation course at the University of Oxford.

## Features

* Implements BGP SPARQL query execution method using C++17
* Demonstrates efficient execution of SPARQL queries
* Provides examples and test cases for various BGP SPARQL queries

## Dependencies

A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
CMake 3.x or higher
(Optional) A modern IDE supporting C++17, such as Visual Studio Code or CLion
''##'' Installation and Setup

Install a C++17 compatible compiler on your machine.
Install CMake 3.x or higher.
Clone the repository:
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bgp-sparql-implementation](https://github.com/bbyiringiro/Database-Systems-Implemenation.git
```
Change the working directory:
bash
```
cd bgp-sparql
```
Create a build directory and navigate to it:
bash
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
Run CMake to generate build files:
```
cmake ..
```
Build the project:
go
```
make
```

Run the compiled binary to execute SPARQL queries using the implemented BGP SPARQL query execution method.
